**Soundwave project for monogames**.

This is a simple solution I created for simulating a soundwave effect on some flags.
The solution itself uses the cosine rule to calculate the wavelength.
over time the wave speed, amplitude and velocity increase.

the math concept used was taken from part 2, Engineering for power in the t193 textbooks for Engineering (OU)
                                
Velocity<sub>x</sub> = Amplitude × cos(Time × Frequency)

the project currently has no max wave speed, amplitude and velocity.
It causes very broken things to happen.

go ahead and use the project to make your own games!
